 * RowProcessors. Each RowProcessor will have its own {@link ParsingContext}. Concrete implementations of this class
 * are expected to implement the  method and analyze the input row
 * to determine whether or not the current {@link RowProcessor} implementation must be changed to handle a special
 * circumstance (determined by the concrete implementation) such as a different row format.
 * <p>
 * When the row processor is switched, the {@link #rowProcessorSwitched(RowProcessor, RowProcessor)} will be called, and
 * must be overridden, to notify the change to the user.
